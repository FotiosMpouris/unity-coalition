      <h1>Unity Coalition Gallery</h1>
      <p>
        As a grassroots initiative built on principles of transparency and collective action, 
        we rely on crowd-sourced support to maintain our independence and build the necessary 
        infrastructure for lasting reform. Every contribution, whether through active participation 
        or financial support, directly funds our core operations, including the development of 
        our communication platform, legal framework, and coordination efforts across our network 
        of reform initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in complete transparency in our operations and funding, which is why we've 
        chosen to use Give Send Go as our donation platform, where you can find detailed information 
        about our funding goals and exactly how contributions will be used to strengthen our 
        coalition's impact. Your support, at any level, helps ensure that this critical work of 
        civic renewal remains independent, effective, and true to its mission of unifying reform 
        efforts across America.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are snapshots from our events, meetups, and community projects. We invite you to 
        explore these moments and be inspired by the growing movement that seeks to unify and 
        empower everyday Americans to shape a brighter civic future.
