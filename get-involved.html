      <h2>A Message from Our Founder</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my journey across America—from local community building in Massachusetts 
        to organizing grassroots events nationwide—I’ve witnessed firsthand how the fragmentation 
        of our civic life affects every community. Yet I’ve also seen an extraordinary willingness 
        among Americans to work together when given the right framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Unity Coalition isn’t just another organization; it’s a practical response to our 
        nation’s deepening divides. We’re building a home for those who recognize that our 
        greatest challenges can only be solved by working across traditional boundaries. 
        Whether you’re concerned about corporate influence, environmental sustainability, 
        or the future of democracy itself, your perspective and participation matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us in creating not just a movement, but a new way forward for American civic life.
      </p>
      <p>
