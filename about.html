      <p>
        The Unity Coalition is a direct response to a 60-year unraveling of America’s civic core. This effort is led by Founder <strong>C. Patrick Clerkin</strong> who, through extensive travels and personal experiences, recognized the need for a unifying platform that bridges divides.

      <p>
        Charles “Patrick” Clerkin is a Boston-area native with a background in mechanical engineering, fraternity leadership, and political engagement. He has traveled extensively throughout middle America, building bridges with a wide range of communities. Patrick ran for City Council on a moderate, independent platform, and later set up a local civic hub on Mighty Networks. His passion for reconciling diverse viewpoints has culminated in the establishment of the Unity Coalition.
