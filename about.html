      <h2>Our Platform</h2>
      <p>
        Our platform serves as a comprehensive nexus for change, focusing 
        on ten crucial domains including corporate accountability, environmental 
        protection, healthcare reform, and democratic integrity. By providing 
        structured spaces for collaboration and knowledge-sharing, we enable 
        diverse groups to transcend ideological boundaries and work together 
        on practical solutions that serve all Americans.

      <h2>About the Founder</h2>
      <img 
        src="images/founderimage.png" 
        alt="Founder of Unity Coalition - Patrick Clerkin" 
        class="founder-image"
      />
      <p>
        Patrick Clerkin’s path to establishing the Unity Coalition emerged 
        from a unique combination of technical expertise and civic engagement. 
        His journey from mechanical engineer to community organizer has been 
        marked by consistent efforts to bridge divides and foster collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through extensive cross-country travels, local political involvement, 
        and leadership in grassroots initiatives, Patrick developed a deep 
        understanding of America’s challenges at both local and national levels. 
        This experience shaped his vision for creating a platform where 
        reform-minded citizens can effectively work together beyond partisan 
        boundaries to achieve lasting positive change.
