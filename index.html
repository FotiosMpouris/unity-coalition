      <h1>Building Civic Unity Across Divides</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the official site of the Unity Coalition — a direct response to the unraveling of America’s civic core.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Our Core Goal</h2>
      <p>
        The Unity Coalition exists to identify the overlap between and join the reform efforts of scattered and drifting Americans. 
        We seek to reestablish a sense of higher-ordered purpose, sustained mutual prosperity, participatory civics, and kinship 
        among long-divided peers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We unify populist, independent, and minor-party forces among the electorate to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consolidate primary goals</li>
        <li>Refine and integrate reform efforts beyond silos</li>
        <li>Connect top-down and bottom-up influencers</li>
        <li>Negotiate with establishment parties and institutions using a clear plan</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Now?</h2>
      <p>
        Public discontent has been rising for decades as civic decline brought further disengagement, polarization, and distrust.
        This dire situation demands a coordinated response not just from the top but from the roots as well, reframing the landscape 
        so that prior political, economic, and social competitors and foes can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set aside differences to find common cause</li>
        <li>Actively participate rather than passively spectate</li>
        <li>Bring about a golden age of revived inner confidence and reinvigorated civic action</li>
        <li>Face new frontiers united, with sensible innovation and regulation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Do It</h2>
      <p>
        We’re building both the <strong>cultural</strong> and the <strong>infrastructural</strong> framework necessary to sustain 
        this initiative over the coming years and decades—beyond partisan politics or any single administration. Our approach includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A communications hub (e.g., Mighty Networks) with distinct spaces for each major topic area, serving as a repository 
          for key resources, an interactive forum, and a place to forge connections.
        </li>
        <li>
          A core management team and legal entity status, ensuring the Coalition can attract financial support and credibility 
          among policymakers, influencers, and citizens alike.
        </li>
        <li>
          Outreach to stakeholders in each topic area to ensure we build a <em>Grand Central Station</em> of reformers, 
          offering direct access for lawmakers, innovators, and grassroots communities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Initial Core Topics</h2>
      <p>We are actively seeking “Super-Influencers” for these areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Corporate capture of institutions and erosion of the middle class</li>
        <li>2. Broken immigration system (legal and illegal)</li>
        <li>3. Ecological contamination</li>
        <li>4. Surveillance, deception, and censorship</li>
        <li>5. Geopolitical instability and forever wars</li>
        <li>6. Debt burden and currency inflation</li>
        <li>7. Chronic physical and mental illness</li>
        <li>8. Loss of election integrity</li>
        <li>9. Civic decline – polarization, disengagement, distrust</li>
        <li>10. Responsible, pro-humanist use of tech</li>
      </ul>
